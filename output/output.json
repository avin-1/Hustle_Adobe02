            "refined_text": "Mail merges from Word generate documents like form letters—for one common example— that are personalized with information like the names and addresses of the recipients. With Acrobat PDFMaker, you can save steps by using a Word mail merge document and corresponding data file to output mail merges directly to PDF. You can even set up PDFMaker to attach those PDFs to email messages that are generated during the PDF-creation process. Note: For information on setting up files for the Word Mail Merge feature, see Microsoft Office Word Help. 1.   In Microsoft Word, open the template that you have created as the basis of your mail merge, or create the file using the Word Mail Merge toolbar and Mail Merge wizard, as needed. Note:  Do not complete the mail merge in Word. Instead, set up and preview the mail merge as usual, so that you can verify that the merge will work correctly. 2.   Do one of the following: Choose  Acrobat  >  Mail Merge . Click the  Mail Merge To Adobe PDF  button on the Mail Merge toolbar (View > Toolbars > Mail Merge). 3.   In the  Acrobat PDFMaker - Mail Merge  dialog box, select the options you want: To specify which records in the data file will be imported into the merged files, select  All  or  Current , or enter a range of pages by typing in the  From  and  To  boxes. To name the PDF that will be created, type in the  Specify PDF File Name  box. Note:  The PDF will be named using this text plus a series of numbers. For example, if you type  JulyLetter  in the  Specify PDF File Name  box, the mail-merged PDFs might appear as JulyLetter_0000123, JulyLetter_0000124, JulyLetter_0000125, and so forth. 4.
